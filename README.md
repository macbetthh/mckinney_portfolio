This is an old banner and business card graphic that I commissioned when I used to live-stream. I am the only one usage rights.

Portfolio Grid Animation / Hover inspiration \

Made quite a few adjustments to match my overall theme, to work properly with hovering grid cells, and to work responsively as best as I could with the current knowledge I have.
